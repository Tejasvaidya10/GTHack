{"transcript": "Good morning, Mr. [PERSON_1]. How have you been feeling since your last visit? Morning, Doctor. I've been okay, but I still feel tired most afternoons. And I've been waking up at night to urinate. How many times at night? About two or three times. Any blurred vision, excessive thirst or weight changes? I'm thirsty all the time. I actually gained around five pounds in the last three months. Have you been checking your sugars at home? Yes, fasting numbers are around 160 to 180. That's higher than we'd like. You're currently taking metformin 1000 milligrams twice daily, correct? Yes. Your blood pressure today is 142 over 88, pulse 84, weight 92 kilograms, VMI around 31. That's in the obese range. We need better control. Any chest pain or shortness of breath? No. Any numbness or tingling in your feet? Sometimes at night. We should check your A1C and kidney function today. I'd also like to add a GLP1 medication to help with both sugar and weight. How's your diet? Not great. I eat rice almost every meal. We'll have you meet with nutrition counseling. Also increase walking to 30 minutes daily. Okay. We'll follow up in three months. Call of sugars go above 250 or you feel dizzy.", "redacted_transcript": "Good morning, Mr. [PERSON_1].
