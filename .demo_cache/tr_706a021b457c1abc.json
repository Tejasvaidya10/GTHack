{"transcript": "What brings you in today? I've had chest discomfort since yesterday evening. Describe it for me. It's like a tight pressure in the center of my chest. Does it go anywhere? To my left arm sometimes. Any sweating nausea or shortness of breath? I felt sweaty last night. How long does it last? About 10-15 minutes at a time. Do you have high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol? I have high cholesterol. Do you smoke? Yes, about half a pack a day. Your blood pressure is 158 over 94, plus 102 oxygen saturation 97%. I'm concerned about your heart. We need an EKG and blood tests immediately. Is it serious? It could be. We want to rule out a heart attack. Okay. Have you taken anything for the pain? Just and pass it. We'll get cardiac enzymes and possibly admit you from monitoring depending on results.", "redacted_transcript": "What brings you in today? I've had chest discomfort since yesterday evening.
